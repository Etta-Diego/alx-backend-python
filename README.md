Directory Structure
Each folder in this repository represents a different project within the ALX Backend curriculum. The structure is as follows:

0x00-python_variable_annotations: Covers variable annotations for cleaner and more maintainable code.
0x01-python_async_function: Focuses on asynchronous programming with asyncio.
0x02-python_async_comprehension: Explores async comprehensions for efficient data handling.
0x03-python_basic_data_structure: Introduces basic data structures and their implementations.
(Add additional directories as you progress.)
